VidsnapAI is a Python-based web application that lets you create Instagram-style reels from uploaded images and optionally convert text into audio using the ElevenLabs API. The text-to-speech functionality is currently commented out to preserve the limited usage quota of the ElevenLabs API key. It features image-to-reel conversion using FFmpeg, optional high-quality TTS, a gallery to view generated reels, a Flask-powered web interface, and organized upload management. The backend is built with Python and Flask, the frontend uses HTML/CSS (Jinja templates), media is processed with FFmpeg, TTS is powered by ElevenLabs API, and all files are stored locally. To get started, clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/VidsnapAI.git && cd VidsnapAI), install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt), create a .env file with ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here, and run the app (python main.py) to open it in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000. Upload images to create reels, and optionally enable TTS by uncommenting code in main.py and text_to_audio.py. The project requires FFmpeg to be installed on your system. Licensed under MIT, with future plans for cloud storage, reel templates, authentication, and drag-and-drop uploads.
I Have Uncommented the text_to_speech function
Just get your api key from ElevanLabs Api key and paste it in folder called config.py
